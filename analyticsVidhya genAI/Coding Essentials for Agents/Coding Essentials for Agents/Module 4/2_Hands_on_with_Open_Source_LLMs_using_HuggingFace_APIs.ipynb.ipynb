              "Generative AI is a technology that produces various types of content, including text, imagery, and audio. It has become more accessible with new user interfaces and advancements in machine learning algorithms. Generative AI has opened up opportunities in areas like movie dubbing and education, but also raises concerns about deepfakes and cybersecurity attacks. Recent breakthroughs in transformers and large language models have enabled generative AI to create engaging text, photorealistic images, and even videos. This technology has the potential to fundamentally change how businesses operate and could be used for tasks like code writing, product development, and supply chain transformation."
